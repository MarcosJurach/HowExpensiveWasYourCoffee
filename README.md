<h1>Project Maintenance & Contact Details</h1>

The people contributed to this project are Alberto Alabau and Marcos Jurach as part of our mid-term analysis project of our Ironhack bootcamp.

<h1>What are you going to see on this project?</h1>

This repo includes a Jupyter Notebook document about our analysis, our dataset with all the tables, each table individually and our presentation.

<h1>Data Source</h1>

You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ylchang/coffee-shop-sample-data-1113?resource=download&select=sales_outlet.csv).

<h1>Description of Dataset</h1>

The data is an artificial data created to prove the power of an analysis software created by its producer. 
Its about the sales of a coffee shop during a single month.

<h1>About our project</h1>

Project goals: Create a correlation between client profiles and items sold with the sales value and feed the marketing/management team.
 
Since the data is from a single month, this analysis can be reproduced by any month's sales data.

<h1>Tools & Methods of Analysis</h1>

We used a variety of instruments, libraries and models to achieve the aforementioned goals. Among others we used: 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- math
- Supervised learning models for classification:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNeighbors

<h1>Provisional Results & Conclusions</h1>

Creating a reliable model to predict revenue is pretty difficult with the amount of data up until now.

The useful model we got is enough to justify some decision on the management and marketing team, but the prediction will be more in a abroad direction instead of a specific revenue.
